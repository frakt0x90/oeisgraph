script to scrape oeis.org and then create a graph of the sequences. One sequence is connected to another if the first has an html link to the second on its page. 

I did not include the graph files or dataset I got from the scrape, but if you raise an issue I can send it to you. I managed to scrape about 200k sequences before I believe I was blocked.
